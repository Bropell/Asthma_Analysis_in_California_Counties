## Machine Learning

The general flow of the machine learning process will be as follows:

As we all finish our designated tasks we will all have input into this process to better the model and optimize the models as best as possible. This will be no easy task due to the abundance of data we will have and will see how well we can predict areas that are at much higher risk of having children being born with asthma or developing asthma.

## Endgame

The end result of the forest classifer will attempt to visualize the tree assuming the results provide sufficient accuracy to do so. 
The generalized idea is shown in the pictures below:
