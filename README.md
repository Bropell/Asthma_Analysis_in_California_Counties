## Machine Learning

The general flow of our machine learning process will be as follows:

As we all finish our designated tasks we will all have input into this process to better the model and optimize the models as best as possible. This will be no easy task due to the abundance of data we will have and will see how well we can predict areas that are at much higher risk of having children being born with asthma or developing asthma.

The end results of forest classifer we are going to attempt to visualize the tree if the results show enough accuracy to do so. This may or may not be possible depending on the the machine learning process and how the outcome is. However the generalized idea is in the pictures below:
