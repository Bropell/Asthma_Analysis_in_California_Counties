# Asthma_Analysis_in_California_Counties
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a machine learning model that will try and help determine what features, 
if any have a correlation with asthma rates in California counties. Based on the relationships discovered between 
the features, the machine learning model will be used to answer questions regarding why certain counties may be above 
or below California's collective asthma rate of 8.8%. The following list includes some of the types of datasets being
used for this analysis:<br>

- Asthma Rates
- Demographics Data
- EV Charging Stations
- Registered EVs
- Wildfire Data
- CO2/Emissions Data
- Weather/Ozone Data
- Traffic Data
