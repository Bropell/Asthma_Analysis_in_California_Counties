# Asthma_Analysis_in_California_Counties

Our team has decided to explore if external environmental factors have any impact on asthma in California and its counties. From this Analysis, we would like to propose how clean energy policies can be beneficial enviromentally and for public health. 

We will be using a ML model to predict if individuals in California are above (1) or below (0) the as asthma rate of 8.8%  

## Week 1

This week started with the initial search for dataset, as listed below. Firstly, we found datasets for the California demographics and asthma rated. Then, searched for datasets with California counties as the primary connection, to account for the external factors we were interested in exploring. 
  •	Asthma Rates
  •	Demographics Data
  •	EV charging Stations
  •	Registered EVs
  •	Wildfire data
  •	Air pollutants
