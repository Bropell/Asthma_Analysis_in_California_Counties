## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a machine learning model that will try and help determine what features, 
if any have a correlation with asthma rates in California counties. Based on the relationships discovered between 
the features, the machine learning model will be used to answer questions regarding why certain counties may be above 
or below California's collective asthma rate of 8.8%. The following list includes some of the types of datasets being
used for this analysis:<br>

- Asthma Rates
- Wildfire Data
- Air Pollution 
- Demographics Data
- Registered EVs
- EV Charging Stations
- Clean Energy Generation (GwH)<br>

As seen from the types of datasets being used, there is a focus on clean energy and certain environmental factors that
could affect clean energy efforts. The motivation for the analysis is to determine the environmental benefits as well as 
the public health benefits in relation to these specific clean energy projects.
