## Machine Learning

The general flow of the machine learning process will be as follows:

All team members will have input into the process to optimize the model, providing the highest target accuracy without overfitting. The 
main challenge here is the abundance of data and ensuring how well predictions can be made regarding areas that are at a much higher risk 
of having children being born with asthma or developing asthma in adolescence.

In the process of running a balanced forest tree model the results solely depend on the values from the matrix.  An example of the balanced forest tree being run is as follows:

The second model ran was a neural learning model which acheived maximum accuracy in very few epochs. It was run over 100 epochs and acheived 1.00 accuracy in approximately 14 epochs. Results are as follows:

Recommendations for enhancing the models would be 
-Enlarge the dataset that is used.
-Change the activation method of the neural model.

## Endgame

The end result of the forest classifer will attempt to visualize the tree assuming the results provide sufficient accuracy to do so. 
The generalized idea is shown in the pictures below:
