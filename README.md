# Asthma_Analysis_in_California_Counties

We decided to develop a machine learning model that will try and help determine what, if any features might cause / correlate with increased rates of asthma. 

Looking specifically at California and its counties, we plan on training this ML model to predict whether or not a county is ABOVE or BELOW the California's collective asthma rate (8.8%). If a county is 8.8% or above, it should receive a score of 1, on the other hand, if the county is below that threshold, it should receive a score of 0. 

We plan on training this model by combining the following California datasets:

    - Asthma Rates
    - Demographics Data
    - EV charging Stations
    - Registered EVs
    - Wildfire data
    - (CO2 / emissions data?)
    - (Weather data / ozone?)
    - (Traffic data?)

After completing and running this ML model, plan on reviewing and determining which features are most successful in determining whether or not a county will be above or below the statewide average for asthma diagnoses.
