## Machine Learning

The general flow of the machine learning process will be as follows:

</p><br>

An attempt was made to optimize the model, providing the highest target accuracy without overfitting. The 
main challenge here is the lack of abundance of data and ensuring how well predictions can be made regarding areas that are at a much higher risk 
of having children being born with asthma or developing asthma in adolescence.

## BalancedRandomForestClassifier

The end result of the forest classifer will attempt to visualize the tree assuming the results provide sufficient accuracy to do so. 
The generalized idea is shown in the pictures below:
