## Machine Learning

The general flow of the machine learning process:

</p><br>

An attempt was made to optimize the model, providing the highest target accuracy without overfitting. The 
main challenge here is the lack of abundance of data and ensuring how well predictions can be made regarding areas that are at a much higher risk 
of having children being born with asthma or developing asthma in adolescence.

## BalancedRandomForestClassifier
The end result of the forest classifer will attempt to visualize the tree assuming the results provide sufficient accuracy to do so. 
The generalized idea is shown in the image below:

## Deep Neural Network Classifier
The deep learning model uses an input layer as well as several hidden layers to feed the output layer. An example image of this model is shown below:
